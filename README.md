# trade-alert-generator
The code helps to generate trade alerts by monitoring real time stock data and analysing the triggers set by the user.
the self project file contains the GUI code which basically creates an interface which asks the relevant inputs from the users.
when the inputs are entered, the functions run triggering the other 2 uploaded files and using web scrapping they constantly monitor the data, taken from MoneyControl website.
when the trigger values entered by the user are hit, it creates a pop up window which basically alerts the user that his trade is ready to be executed.
the main advantage of this code is that you can add multiple alerts in the same code with succession and you dont need to constantly monitor your trades.
